# Difference Between .bashrc and .bash_profile
.bash_profile is read and executed when Bash is invoked as an interactive login shell
.bashrc is executed for an interactive non-login shell.
Use .bash_profile to run commands that should run only once, such as customizing the $PATH environment variable .
